## Introduction

In the real estate industry, accurately predicting property prices is crucial for buyers, sellers, and real estate agents. Machine learning models can analyze various factors influencing property prices and provide valuable insights for decision-making. This project focuses on building a predictive model for property prices based on a diverse set of features.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset used in this project initially required preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical features. We performed the following steps:

- Filled missing values in certain columns with appropriate strategies.
- Detected and removed outliers using a z-score threshold.
- Renamed columns for better readability.
- Standardized data types and formats.
- Converted categorical variables into numerical representations using one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (property price). Key explorations include:

- Correlation analysis between features and target variable.
- Distribution of property prices and other numerical features.
- Visualization of categorical features and their impact on property prices.

## Feature Engineering

To improve model performance, we engineered additional features from existing data. This involved:

- Converting area measurements to a standardized unit (e.g., square meters).
- Creating new features based on domain knowledge (e.g., price per square meter).
- Encoding categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for modeling.

## Model Building

For predicting property prices, we utilized linear regression, a commonly used regression technique. The model was trained on a subset of the dataset, with features as independent variables and property prices as the dependent variable. We split the data into training and test sets to evaluate model performance.

## Evaluation

The trained model was evaluated using various performance metrics, including:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average of absolute differences between predicted and actual prices.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of squared differences between predicted and actual prices.
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of MSE, providing a measure of prediction accuracy.
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): Average of absolute percentage differences between predicted and actual prices.

These metrics help assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness in predicting property prices.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict property prices based on various factors. By preprocessing data, performing exploratory analysis, engineering features, and building a predictive model, we aim to provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the real estate industry.
